- ## Description
- The `/users/register` endpoint is responsible for registering a new user in the system. It performs the following steps:
-
- 1. Validates the request body using the `express-validator` library. If there are any validation errors, it returns a 400 Bad Request response with the errors.
- 2. Extracts the `fullname`, `email`, and `password` from the request body.
- 3. Hashes the password using the `userModel.hashPassword` function.
- 4. Creates a new user in the system using the `userService.createUser` function, passing in the `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, and `hashedPassword`.
- 5. Generates an authentication token for the new user using the `user.generateAuthToken` function.
- 6. Returns a 201 Created response with the generated token and the user object.
